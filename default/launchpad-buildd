# launchpad-buildd is disabled.
# When enabled, launchpad-buildd accepts network commands and runs them as root.
# If you are sure this server will only be reachable by trusted machines, edit
# /etc/default/launchpad-buildd to enable it.

# When 'yes', this machine will accept tcp connections and run arbitrary jobs
# as root.  Do not enable this except on dedicated machines on a tightly
# controlled network. 
#
# When 'no', the buildd will not run at all.
