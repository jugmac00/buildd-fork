This project is the build daemon used by Launchpad's package-building
infrastructure.

file LICENCE) except for some files originating elsewhere, which are marked

See https://dev.launchpad.net/ for more context.

----

In order to build the package you need dpkg-dev and fakeroot

To build the package do:

debian/rules package
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

It will "fail" because the package built in the "wrong" place. Don't
worry about that.

To clean up, do:

fakeroot debian/rules clean
rm launchpad-buildd*deb
rm ../launchpad-buildd*changes


Developing
************

First of all, it is recommended that you create a lxc container, since the
following steps will make changes in your system. You can create a container
with the following command:

        lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 lp-builddev

Note that you may want to have a profile to share the source code with the
container before running the above command.

Then, inside the container, install the necessary dependencies:

        sudo apt-get update
        cat system-dependencies.txt | sudo xargs apt-get install -y

This should be enough for you to be able to run `make check`, which runs the
test suite both in python2 and python3.

Now, happy coding.


Production deployment notes
***************************

In Launchpad's production build farm, launchpad-buildd is deployed via base
virtual machine images constructed by taking standard Ubuntu cloud images
and installing launchpad-buildd in them from
https://launchpad.net/~canonical-is-sa/+archive/ubuntu/buildd.  This is done
by
https://code.launchpad.net/~canonical-sysadmins/canonical-is-charms/launchpad-buildd-image-modifier
(currently private, sorry).

At present (May 2020), all these base VM images are built from Ubuntu
xenial, and launchpad-buildd runs on Python 2.  We plan to upgrade these to
bionic soon, where it will be possible for launchpad-buildd to run on Python
3; however, it's necessary to support the powerpc architecture until at
least April 2021 (end of standard maintenance for xenial), and the powerpc
base images will need to stay on xenial since that architecture is no longer
supported by bionic.  As a result, launchpad-buildd must run on both Python
2 and 3 for the time being.
