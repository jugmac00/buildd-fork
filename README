----

In order to build the package you need dpkg-dev and fakeroot

To build the package do:

debian/rules package
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

It will "fail" because the package built in the "wrong" place. Don't
worry about that.

To clean up, do:

fakeroot debian/rules clean
rm launchpad-buildd*deb
rm ../launchpad-buildd*changes

Production deployment notes
***************************

In Launchpad's production build farm, launchpad-buildd is deployed via base
virtual machine images constructed by taking standard Ubuntu cloud images
and installing launchpad-buildd in them from
https://launchpad.net/~canonical-is-sa/+archive/ubuntu/buildd.  This is done
by
https://code.launchpad.net/~canonical-sysadmins/canonical-is-charms/launchpad-buildd-image-modifier
(currently private, sorry).

At present (May 2020), all these base VM images are built from Ubuntu
xenial, and launchpad-buildd runs on Python 2.  We plan to upgrade these to
bionic soon, where it will be possible for launchpad-buildd to run on Python
3; however, it's necessary to support the powerpc architecture until at
least April 2021 (end of standard maintenance for xenial), and the powerpc
base images will need to stay on xenial since that architecture is no longer
supported by bionic.  As a result, launchpad-buildd must run on both Python
2 and 3 for the time being.
